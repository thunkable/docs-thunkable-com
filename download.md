### Troubleshooting

Common issues

**You receive an email from the hard-working beaver saying that this app will not build**

* You uploaded an icon that has the same name as an existing asset that you have uploaded
* Your app icon is not an image file
* Your app icon contains transparent pixels. Apple does not allow you to have any icons with any transparent colors
* We are having trouble with our build servers. Please try again in 30 minutes or chat with us if you are still having problems
* App \(Bundle\) ID. Your App \(Bundle\) ID is a series of short strings of text that are separated by periods, such as **com.thunkable.creator.app**. These string of text must i\) be lowercase, ii\) begin with a letter.
  * Examples of App \(Bundle\) IDs that can cause errors: com.thunkable.creator.1app, Com.Thunkable.Creator.APP
* Asset names. We recommend that asset names **only** contain Roman alphabet characters with no accents, and numbers.
  * Examples of asset names that could cause errors: image\(1\).jpg, imÃ£ge.jpg
  * Examples of asset names that won't cause errors: image1.jpg, image.jpg

**You cannot install your app and get the message "Cannot connect to storage.googleapis.com"**

* You have a special character like "&" in your [App Name](project-settings.md#app-name)

**When you install your app on Android, you see the message "There was a problem parsing the Package"**

* This is caused by your package name, also known in your project as your App \(Bundle\) ID. Your App \(Bundle\) ID is a series of short strings of text that are separated by periods, such as **com.thunkable.creator.app**. These string of text must i\) be lowercase, ii\) begin with a letter.
  * Examples of App \(Bundle\) IDs that can cause errors: com.thunkable.creator.1app, Com.Thunkable.Creator.APP
