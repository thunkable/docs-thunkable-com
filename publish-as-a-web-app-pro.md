# Publish as a Web App

Publishing as a web app is the fastest way to publish your Thunkable app. This means that you can get user feedback in minutes instead of hours or days. One major advantage to publishing on the internet is that you don't need to pay additional fees to an app marketplace.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Publishing as a web app is available for Thunkable creators with active pro subscriptions. To upgrade your subscription please visit your [membership page](https://x.thunkable.com/account/membership). If you cancel your pro membership, your app will be unpublished once your pro membership expires.
{% endhint %}

## Mobile Web App

Mobile web apps are best experienced by opening the link directly on your phone. To make your mobile app feel more like a native app you can add it to the [home screen](https://intercom.help/thunkable/en/articles/3828958-add-to-home-screen) directly from your mobile web browser.

If you preview a mobile web app on a desktop or laptop computer you will see a phone frame around the app. This is to give you a rough idea of its final proportions, but ultimately this will vary from device to device depending on factors such as screen size, aspect ratio, and pixel density.

To get an app that can respond to devices of any size, consider publishing as a [Responsive Web App](publish-as-a-web-app-pro.md#responsive-web-app).

## Responsive Web App

Publishing your app as a responsive web app means that it will scale according to the size of the device that it is being opened on.&#x20;

If your app in designed only to be run on phones, consider publishing as a [Mobile Web App](publish-as-a-web-app-pro.md#mobile-web-app).

üéâ Congratulations - your Thunkable project is now live on the internet a published web app.

## Publish to a custom domain

### Configure your domain

You need to configure your domain before you can publish your app to that domain. To do so, add the Thunkable IP address (34.136.177.42) to the A record of your domain which you can usually find in the DNS section of your domain provider.

Here are the instructions from some popular domain name providers:&#x20;

* [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/319/2237/how-can-i-set-up-an-a-address-record-for-my-domain/)
* [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html#AFormat)
* [Digital Ocean](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/dns/how-to/manage-records/)
* [Google Domains](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/3290350?hl=en)
* [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/help/add-an-a-record-19238)

DNS synchronization often takes less than an hour but may take up to 72 hours. If your domain is not connecting within 48 hours, we recommend the following troubleshooting steps:

* Confirm the IP address added to your A record is the correct IP (34.136.177.42).
* Ensure you are using `http://` and not `https://`.

### Publish to a custom domain

**Note:** The windows you see may look slightly different from the ones shown below. The windows and prompts vary based on whether or not you‚Äôve published your app as a web app previously.

9. Click **Done**.

## Updating your App

Each time you press publish it‚Äôs similar to creating a new release of your app in one of stores. This means you can make changes and updates to your  without worrying about users seeing a half-finished new feature that you‚Äôre still working on.

When you‚Äôre ready to release a new version, choose ‚ÄúPublish as a Web App‚Äù then click the blue ‚ÄúPublish current version‚Äù to update your app. The URL will remain the same, but the project that it links to will be updated.

## Embed your app in a webpage

If you host a webpage, you can embed your Thunkable web app in an iframe using the syntax

`<iframe src="https://thunkable.site/w/K0XDxMqwl" title="Chop Down the Tree Thunkable App" height = 1000 width = 500></iframe>`

You can read more about iframes [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag\_iframe.ASP).
