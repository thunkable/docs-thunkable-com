# üîí Blockchain & Data Privacy

**In partnership with** [**Oasis Labs**](http://www.oasislabs.com)**, you can now build mobile applications that include components of blockchain and built-in privacy technologies on Thunkable.**

1. Oasis Labs is a beta product. As a result there may be system updates that impact your app's ability to connect to the platform or even loose data during major quarterly upgrades. You can learn more [_here_](http://docs.oasiscloud.io/en/latest/dashboard-quickstart/) about upgrade cycles\)
2. If you are testing on iOS, please open and force quit the Thunkable Live App before testing Oasis components. 

## **Using Oasis to build new experiences**

Using Oasis technology, developers can quickly and easily build new types of experiences in your app that incorporate blockchain and privacy technologies.

Incorporating elements from Oasis can be particularly valuable for apps that need to preserve data privacy or require a high level of verifiability. For example, you can use Oasis components to build a messaging app that keeps what you write secret, or a supply chain application where shipping times can be verified and unalterable.

Below are a number of sample applications that you can use as templates to get started.

## **Sample Apps to get started**

Take these samples as a template to build your own apps. Download them as is or remix them and make them your own!

* [Supply Chain Ledger](https://x.thunkable.com/copy/52a5807a9c643b9b307ffa1c6457448c)

## Scavenger Hunt -- **Making a verifiable location-based application**

The ‚ÄúScavenger Hunt‚Äù app allows you to create a ‚Äúgeo hotspot‚Äù on a map . When the user is within the geo hotspot, they can click on the ‚ÄúUnlock Location‚Äù button to receive a Hunt Token. Hunt Tokens \(and other tokens\) are created on the Oasis Blockchain.

You can easily customize this app by changing the geo hotspot area that can give you coins when you are within its boundaries.

## **Building and deploying your own smart contract on Thunkable**

If you‚Äôd like to build a mobile app with smart contract and blockchain technology from scratch, you can also use the [Oasis Developer Dashboard](http://dashboard.oasiscloud.io) to write your own smart contract, connect it to Thunkable using the [Blockchain Wallet](https://docs.thunkable.com/oasisweb3) and [Smart Contract](https://docs.thunkable.com/oasissmartcontract) components.  
  
In less than an hour, you‚Äôll have a complete mobile app that you can submit to the Apple App Store or Google Play.
