# Thunkable Live

## **What is Thunkable Live?**

Thunkable Live is an app that connects the projects in your web browser directly to your mobile device. It allows you to do two things:

1. You can [**Live Test**](file:///@thunkable/s/thunkable-docs/~/edit/drafts/-LnCeo225SCFice-kzC9/live-test#live-test) your project. Any changes you make in your browser are displayed on your device, while you are working.
2. You can [**Live Preview**](file:///@thunkable/s/thunkable-docs/~/edit/drafts/-LnCeo225SCFice-kzC9/live-test#live-preview) any of your projects, directly on your device, without the need to be logged in to your computer.

## **Download Thunkable Live**

The Thunkable app allows you to live test your app on your device, in real-time, while you are building it. Not even hard core developers have this super power. You can also preview all your app projects from the comfort of your mobile device.

If you don't have an iOS or Android device, you can also [set up an emulator](file:///@thunkable/s/thunkable-docs/~/edit/drafts/-LnCeo225SCFice-kzC9/emulators) on your computer that will mimic what you would see on an actual device.‌

With Thunkable Live installed on your device, you are now ready to live test or to live preview.‌

## **Live Test**

While live testing, any changes that you make to your project should be reflected in your app. Bear in mind that the Thunkable Live app doesn't check your project for errors. Some changes that you make may crash the app. If this happens simply exit out of the app and re-open it.

### **Getting started**

From any of your Thunkable projects, click on the **Live Test** button at the top of the screen to begin live testing.
