### Numeric value

You can also round up or down a decimal figure into an integer using the block below

There is also a block for irrational numbers like `π`

### Perform calculations

Perhaps the most often used calculation in an app is `addition` but this block also supports `subtraction`, `multiplication`, `division` and `exponential` figures

There are also a few more advanced calculation blocks that may be helpful including `trigonometric`

and `remainder`

### Introduce randomness

For games and other apps, it may be important to introduce randomness into your app

One way to select randomly from a list is depicted below
