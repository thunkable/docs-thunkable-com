#### Important note for your friends

Anyone installing your app directly, instead of from the Play Store, will need to change the setting on their phone to allow installation of non-market applications.

To find this setting on versions of Android prior to 4.0, go to "Settings &gt; Applications" and then check the box next to "Unknown Sources". For devices running Android 4.0 or above, go to "Settings &gt; Security" or "Settings &gt; Security & Screen Lock" and then check the box next to "Unknown Sources" and confirm your choice.
