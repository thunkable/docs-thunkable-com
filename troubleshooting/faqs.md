# FAQs

**How much does it cost to use Thunkable âœ•?**

Thunkable is free to use to create public projects. Thunkable charges a maintenance fee for the use of certain components such as Payment by Stripe and Ads by AdMob.

For users who want to keep their projects private, users have the option of upgrading to Thunkable PRO. [Learn more about PRO](https://thunkable.com/#/pricing).

**What does it mean if my project is public or private?**

Public projects are included in the Thunkable Public Gallery for anyone to preview and remix. Private projects are just that, private. They are not included in the Thunkable Gallery and are for your eyes only.

Private projects can only be shared with other PRO users. Please note: If you share your project with another PRO user, they have the ability to make the project public.
