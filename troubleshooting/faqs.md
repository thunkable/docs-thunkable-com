## **Account Questions**

### **How much does it cost to use Thunkable?**

Thunkable is free to use to create public projects.

We offer paid plans for individuals and businesses who are looking for extra features to meet their needs. [Learn more about our paid plans here](https://thunkable.com/#/pricing).

### **What does it mean if my project is public or private?**

Public projects are included in the Thunkable Public Gallery for anyone to preview and remix. Private projects are just that, private. They are not included in the Thunkable Gallery and are for your eyes only.

Private projects can only be shared with other PRO users. Please note: If you share your project with another PRO user, they have the ability to make the project public.
