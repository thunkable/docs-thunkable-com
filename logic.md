## Comparison Blocks

[If `then`, do `that`](control.md#if-this-do-that) blocks are often paired with statement blocks that test whether a condition is met

The comparison blocks will compare two values and return **true** or **false** based on whether the condition is met.

You can compare multiple conditions at once.

The **and **block will return **true **if both statements are true, **false** otherwise.

The **or **block will return **true **if either statement is true, and **false **if neither statement is true.

## Not

Inverts the value of a true/false statement. Not true = false, not false = true.

## Value Blocks

Value blocks can be used to set the value of a variable. They can be used in conjunction with any of the above blocks.
