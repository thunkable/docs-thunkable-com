A button is just something you can click on to perform an action. This action can be anything from navigating to a different screen, saving information to a database, or playing a sound.

## Edit the Button size

You can set how tall the button is using the height property and set how wide the button is using the width property.

**Height**

* **Fill container -** The button fills the entire screen vertically
* **Fit contents -** The  button’s height changes to be the size of the contents it contains
* **Relative size -** The button fills the specified percentage of the screen
* **Absolute size -** Sizes the button to a specified number of pixels

**Width**

* **Fill container -** The button fills the entire screen horizontally
* **Fit contents -** The button’s width changes to be the size of the contents it contains
* **Relative size -** The button fills the specified percentage of the screen
* **Absolute -** Sizes the button to a specified number of pixels

## Add Spacing

You change the spacing and positioning of the button with the Margin and Padding properties.   
**Margin**

* You can specify how much space you want between the edges of the button and the screen using either pixel or percent values.

**Padding**

* You can specify how much space you want between the border and contents of the button using either pixel or percent values.

## Properties

### Background Color

The get and set background color properties work with the color of the button itself i.e. the region behind the button text. Best practice is to use one of the built [color blocks](colour.md) to set this value, but you can use HEX and RGB values too.

### Background Picture

* Cover
* Contain
