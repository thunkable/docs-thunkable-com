# Canvas

The canvas component is a touch-sensitive panel that enables the movement of items. 

You can use this component to create a variety of games and experiences that involve different methods of touching a screen.

## Adding a Canvas 

To add a canvas to your app, drag and drop the canvas component into the app builder. A tab for the canvas will appear. Click on the canvas tab to customize your app.

Canvas components contain stages, which allow you to set the background color of the game.
