## Display PDF

### Upload PDF

You can upload a PDF as an [Asset](assets.md) to your app and display it in the PDF Viewer.

### Use URL

You can enter a URL that points to a PDF on the web to display in your PDF. Make sure this URL ends in `.pdf`

{% hint style="info" %}
There is a size limit of 50MB per app. For larger PDFs, either reduce the size of the file before uploading to your Thunkable project, or host your PDF online and use a URL that points to it in your app
{% endhint %}
