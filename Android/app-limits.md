#### Most common causes of apps not building or crashes

* [Extensions](/Android/extensions.md)
  * Extensions are created by the community and many of them work wonderfully on Thunkable.  A few of them do lead to more frequent app crashes
* Images
  * App icon too large \(we recommend 96 px by 96 px\)
  * Too many / too large images \(the app size limit is 10MB\)
  * Some users have detected that Thunkable works better with .pngs than .jpgs
* Too many screens \(there is not a hard limit on 10 screens but performance reduces beyond that\)
* Blocks
  * Errors in blocks \(usually this will prevent the app from building\)
  * Too many blocks \(we have seen a few cases where a lot of blocks create performance issues\)
