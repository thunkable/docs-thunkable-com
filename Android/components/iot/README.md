# Internet of Things \(IoT\)

---

The Internet of Things is the inter-networking of physical devices, smart devices, buildings and other items embedded with electronics or sensors that enable the objects to collect and exchange data.

Many smartphones have the ability to communicate not just through Wi-Fi and mobile data networks but also Bluetooth and NFC, two mediums which require much less power and are more commonly retrofitted into every day objects.
