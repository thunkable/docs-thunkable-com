Speech Recognizer is a powerful Google component that uses artificial intelligence to transcribes a user's speech into English text. The transcription is powered by a significant database of human speech and text that finds the best possible match for a given user's sound.

The speech recognizer is used in the sample app [ThunkableChat: Chat with Instant Translation](https://www.gitbook.com/book/albertching/thunkable-docs/edit#)![](/assets/speech-recognizer-fig-1.png)
