# Troubleshooting

---

---

### `AdMob` ![](/assets/admob-icon.png)

Common issues

* Ads are not showing up
  * AdMob account created very recently. Usually it takes at least a few hours for the account to be activated
  * For Banner Ads, Screen set to 'Fixed'. Screen needs to be set to 'Responsive'
  * Load Ad block not called in Blocks Editor
  * Account has been suspended by AdMob. Clicking ads on your own app can lead to suspensions as can one or more users repeatedly clicking the ads on your app. Accounts can also be suspended for deceptive ad placement that generates accidental clicks
  * [Check the AdMob forum for more potential errors](https://community.thunkable.com/c/professional/admob)
