# Organizations

**Note:** Organizations is currently being beta-tested.

## Overview

Thunkable Organizations is a set of administration and collaboration capabilities that allow multiple team members to work on a single project. Creators can jointly design and develop a single, shared project asynchronously.&#x20;

A single Creator can edit the project at a time, and their changes are available for other members to view when they refresh their page.&#x20;

## Organization Management

{% hint style="info" %}
To get started with Thunkable Organizations, please contact the Thunkable team here: [book a meeting](https://meetings.hubspot.com/bryan-luckyheard/team-pricing-request).
{% endhint %}

The Thunkable team will take care of setting up and managing your organization. If you need to add a member to your organization after it's created, simply reach out to your Thunkable representative to make that request.

## Assigning a Project to an Organization

When creating a new project, Organization members can assign the project to their own personal projects or the Organization.&#x20;

Projects assigned to the Organization can be collaborated on by members of the Organization.&#x20;

_This decision cannot be undone._&#x20;

Once a project is assigned to an Organization, it cannot be converted to a personal project and vice-versa. It remains a part of the Organization and cannot be moved to any one Creator’s personal projects, including the Admin of the Organization.

Projects created within an organization cannot be shared with users outside of the Organization.

## Viewing and Editing Modes

When accessing Organization projects, members are in one of two modes: Editing or Viewing. There can only be one project member in Editing mode at any given time – all other members of the Organization remain in Viewing mode.&#x20;

Members accessing the project in Viewing mode cannot make active changes to the shared project.

### Transferring Editing Access

Only one project member can be in Editing mode at a time.&#x20;

* To request editing access, a member in Viewing mode must click the chevron next to **VIEWING**.
* Click **Request Edit**.
* The member currently in Editing mode is notified that another member has requested editing access.
* When the member currently in Editing mode switches to View mode, the member requesting Editing access is switched to Editing mode and can make changes to the project.

**Note:** If the member currently in Editing mode is offline, no other member can edit the project. The member currently in Editing mode must come back online and grant access to a different member.\
