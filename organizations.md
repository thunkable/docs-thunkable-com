# Organizations

**Note:** Organizations is currently being beta-tested.

## Overview

Thunkable Organizations is a set of administration and collaboration capabilities that allow multiple team members to work on a single project. Creators can jointly design and develop a single, shared project asynchronously.&#x20;

A single Creator can edit the project at a time, and their changes are available for other members to view when they refresh their page.&#x20;

## Organization Management

{% hint style="info" %}
To get started with Thunkable Organizations, please contact the Thunkable team here: [book a meeting](https://meetings.hubspot.com/bryan-luckyheard/team-pricing-request). The Thunkable team will take care of setting up and managing your organization.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Thunkable Creators have:&#x20;

* roles with the organization (admin or member)
* permissions within a project (project owner, editor, or viewer)
* modes when actively within a project (editing or viewing)

## Assigning a Project to an Organization

### Creating a New Project in an Organization

When creating a new project, Organization members can assign it to their own personal projects or the Organization.&#x20;

Projects assigned to the Organization can be collaborated on by members of the Organization.&#x20;

Once a project is assigned to an Organization, it cannot be converted to a personal project. It remains part of the Organization and cannot be moved to any one Creator’s personal projects, including the Admin of the Organization.

Projects created within an organization cannot be shared with users outside of the Organization.

## Viewing and Editing Modes

When accessing Organization projects, members are in one of two modes: Editing or Viewing. There can only be one project member in Editing mode at any given time – all other members of the Organization remain in Viewing mode.&#x20;

Members accessing the project in Viewing mode cannot make active changes to the shared project.
