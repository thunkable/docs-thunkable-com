# Thunkable Projects

A project is where your designs, files, and blocks combine to create Android, iOS, and web apps.&#x20;

## Public vs. Private Projects

### Public Projects

Public projects are included in the Thunkable Public Gallery for anyone to preview, download or remix. If you create a public project, please know that it can be viewed by anyone in the Thunkable community.&#x20;

### Private Projects

Private projects are available to Creators on Pro+ plans. These projects are private, meaning they can only be seen by their app creator. They are not displayed in the Thunkable Public Gallery.&#x20;

Learn more about our plans here: [Thunkable Pricing Plans](https://thunkable.com/#/pricing)

### Making Projects Public or Private

For Creators on Pro+ plans, you can decide whether a project is public or private when you create it.&#x20;

You can also change the privacy setting of an existing app. Click the gear icon in the upper left to access your app's  [Project Settings](../../settings/project-settings/) and use the switch to change the app's privacy settings.

## Read-Only projects

Private projects become Read-Only projects when a Creator's [Pro membership](https://thunkable.com/#/pricing) expires. Read-Only projects remain private and are not included in the Thunkable Gallery.

You can only preview Read-Only. Once a project has been switched to public, you cannot switch it back to Read-Only.

## App Layout and Size

By default, a Thunkable project is the size of a mobile phone in portrait mode. If you want to change this, you can do this by adjusting the default app layout in the Settings panel of your project. [Learn more about this here](../../settings/project-settings/#default-app-layout).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that your layout will not automatically respond when you change your Default App Layout. Your existing components will not change size, and the distance between components will not change. We recommend setting your Default App Layout before you start adding components to your app.
{% endhint %}
