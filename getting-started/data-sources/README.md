# Data Sources

## Overview

When a data source powers your app, you can continuously update your app contents without having to republish it. It allows you to build a dynamic app that can create, read, update, and delete data.&#x20;

You can choose one of the following data sources:

{% content-ref url="data-sources.md" %}
[data-sources.md](data-sources.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="data-sources-1.md" %}
[data-sources-1.md](data-sources-1.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="data-sources-2.md" %}
[data-sources-2.md](data-sources-2.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="data-sources-3.md" %}
[data-sources-3.md](data-sources-3.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Data Viewer Components

Once you have connected your project to a data source, you can use the data viewer components as a presentation layer to display the data in your data source.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../../app-design/ui-components/data-components/data-viewers/" %}
[data-viewers](../../app-design/ui-components/data-components/data-viewers/)

### Data Sources Blocks

By incorporating the data source blocks into your app, you can allow users to create, read, update, and delete data in your data source when they interact with the data viewer.

{% content-ref url="../../blocks/app-features/data-sources-blocks.md" %}
[data-sources-blocks.md](../../blocks/app-features/data-sources-blocks.md)
