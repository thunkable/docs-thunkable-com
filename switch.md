# Switch

A switch is a component that has two settings, true and false. You can get your app to do specific tasks only if the switch is set to true. 

* [Set up](switch.md#set-up)
* [Style the Switch](switch.md#style-the-switch)

To enable the Switch, you'll have to use the block below to set the Switch `value` to the `newValue` when you turn on and off the switch.

* **On Tint Color:** Color of the switch track when switch set to on 
* **Thumb Tint Color:** Color of the switch thumb
