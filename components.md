# üõ†Ô∏è UI Components and App Features

## User Interface (UI) Components

UI components are visual elements users can see or interact with. They include buttons, images, text inputs, etc. Thunkable offers more than 20 UI components to add to your app screens. ÔªøEach of these components is fully customizable and controllable with blocks.

### Properties Panel

Each UI component you add to your app has an associated properties panel unique to that component. Using the various settings in the properties panel, you can style and customize your Thunkable UI components to give your app personality and style that best suits your brand.

A Label's properties panel is displayed on the right in the example below. Note its unique properties such as font, color, alignment, etc.&#x20;

### The Component Tree

The component tree can be found at the top left corner of your project's Designer. The component tree contains a list of the UI components in your app. The expand and collapse arrows show or hide the nested UI components.
