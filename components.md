# üõ†Ô∏è Components and Features

## What's a Component?

Components are the building blocks of your Thunkable app. They can help your app look a certain way or have a certain functionality.&#x20;

UI Components (User Interface Components) are components which you can see on the screen. Examples include buttons, loading icons, and images.&#x20;

Thunkable also offer interactivity for App Features. These App Features offer control of mobile specific functions as well as non-UI components. Examples include sounds, timers, camera, and sensors to name a few.

## UI Components

[UI Components](ui-components.md) make up the visual aspect of your user interface. Combine, style and customize Thunkable UI components to give your app personality and style that best suits your brand.

Each UI component has unique properties that you can use to customize it. You can find this at the top of the **Properties panel**. All UI components have a section called **Layout** and **Style**.&#x20;

In the example above, a **Label** has been selected. Note its unique properties such as its font, color, alignment, etc.&#x20;

## App Features

[App Features](app-features.md) are features offer non-UI functionality.&#x20;

They often relate to your app's functionality, and are quietly running in the background. Add App Features in the Blocks tab of your project.
