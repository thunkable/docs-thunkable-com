There are two kinds of components that you can add to your app -- Visible components that appear on your screen and Invisible or sometimes referred to as API components that work across screens in the background.

* [Invisible or API Components](components.md#invisible-or-api-components)

## Visible Components

Visible components have common sets of properties usually sizing, styling & text styling, spacing, positioning. You may often have multiple visible components on a single screen and sometimes dozens if not hundreds in a single app.

## Invisible or API Components

Invisible components often require some set-up and usually are limited to one type of invisible component per app \(since you do not need to add them across screens
