# 🛠️ Components

## What's a component?

Apps contain many different features. On Thunkable, you get to pick and choose which features--which we call components--go into your app. 

Some features you can see. Let's call these features visible components. Examples include buttons, loading icons and images. 

Some features you can't see. Let's call these features invisible components. Examples include sounds that your app makes, or powerful technology like databases.

## Visible Components

To put it simply, visible components are features that you can see on your app screen--like the ones pictures above.  

Visible components can be styled by size, text, space and location. 

When adding visible components into your app, please note that they can only exist on one screen at a time. For example, if you want to add a button to three different screens, each screen will require it's own button.

## Invisible Components

Invisible components are features on your app that you can't see. They often relate to your app's functionality, and are quietly running in the background. When you add an invisible component to your app, that component can work on any screen. 

For example, if you add a database to your app, that database can be accessed from any screen. You do not need to add a database component to each screen.
