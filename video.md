# Video

## Video Overview

The Video component lets you play videos in your project that are stored in the cloud or in your project. Users can easily pause, rewind or fast-forward the video with this player.

## Set Video

There are a few ways you can set a video source in your app:

### Upload Video File to your app

You can upload a video file as an [asset](assets.md#uploading-and-managing-assets) in your project. Be careful of the Thunkable 50 MB [app size limit](assets.md#app-size-limits-50-mb-per-app) if you choose to upload a file to your project.

### Enter URL to choose video to display

Enter the URL of the video you want to show in your project.

The link has to end in `.mp4`, `.mov`, â€¦so videos uploaded to YouTube and other video sharing sites may not work.

Please note that the Video component is not recommended for streaming live video content.&#x20;
