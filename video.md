# Video

## Video Overview

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that video files can be quite large and might exceed the 50 MB [size limit](assets.md#app-size-limits-50-mb-per-app) for your project. 
{% endhint %}

The Video component lets you play videos in your app that are stored in the cloud or in your app. App users can easily pause, rewind or fast-forward the video with the built in player.

## Set Video

There are a few ways you can set a video source in your app:

1. **Upload a video to your app.** Be careful of the Thunkable 50 MB [app size limit](assets.md#app-size-limits-50-mb-per-app)
2. **Provide a link to the video.** The link has to end in `.mp4`, `.mov`, …so videos uploaded to YouTube and other video sharing sites may not work.

Please note that the Video component is not recommended for streaming live video content. 

## Edit size and position

You can drag and drop your component into position, and set its size.   
You can set exact values for the component's Height and Width, and X and Y coordinates, in its properties.

**Height:** Height of Button in pixels  
**Width:** Width of Button in pixels

**X:** position of top left corner of Button on X-axis  
**Y:** position of top right corner of component on Y-axis

## Set to Auto-Play

To set a video to play automatically, just toggle the Play property to `true`
