# 🤖 Core Blocks

An app is simply a sequence of events.

The best apps define an elegant sequence of events that happen without the user even noticing. A great sign in flow for example can happen in seconds but the logic and sequence behind them is a work of art that has been iterated on many times \(often using Thunkable's [Live Testing](get-started/live-test.md) app\).

This is where Thunkable Blocks come in.

Thunkable Blocks are the building blocks of a great experience for your app users. Every component has its own set of blocks to start or trigger an event and set and change properties.

They can be connected to a commonly used set of blocks that range from opening screens, setting up logic, reformatting data or simplifying code.
