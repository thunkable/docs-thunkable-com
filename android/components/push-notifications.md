# Push Notifications by One Signal ![](/assets/one-signal-icon.png)

---

User retention in apps is hard and push notifications can be a very valuable asset to continue to engage with your app audience after they have downloaded your app.

However, like ads, being overly aggressive can backfire and have a negative effect on your users. Annoying notifications--those that are irrelevant and too frequent--are the number one reason why users uninstall mobile apps.

We recommend limiting push notifications to content that will be welcomed by a large majority of your users. Less is more!

| App type | Notification frequency | Message content |
