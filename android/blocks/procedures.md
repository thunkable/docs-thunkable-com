# Procedures \(aka Functions\)

---

We use procedures, also known as functions in Thunkable to create new blocks that we can use repeatedly and take up less space than all of the blocks used in the original procedure. If we are using the same sets of blocks more than once, these blocks are redundant and in general we try to avoid duplication.

Procedure blocks can have inputs \(also known as arguments\) which you can add by selecting the blue settings button. Usually you define a procedure in your app and then call it when you're ready to use it in your app.

* [Call a procedure](#call-a-procedure)
