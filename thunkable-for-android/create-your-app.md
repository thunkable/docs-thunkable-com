# Step 2 `Create`

We designed Thunkable to work for non-developers by eliminating the need to write any code to build a powerful and beautiful native, mobile app. Creating your first app on Android should take only a few steps

1. [Login](#1--login-to-thunkable-for-android-)
2. [Create a new project](#2--create-a-new-project)
3. [Rename your app \(and upload app icon\)](#3--rename-app-and-upload-app-icon)
4. [Add component\(s\)](#step-5：-add-app-components)
5. [Add functionality](#--step-6：-add-functionality)

If this is your first time on Thunkable, we highly recommend that you [watch this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ7z3t-98O0)

### 3 / Rename App \(and Upload App Icon\)

You can change your App Name to be different than your Project Name \(otherwise they will be the same by default\). The App Name is what shows up underneath your app icon on your user's phones

### 4 / **Add App Component\(s\)** {#step-5：-add-app-components}

As you create your app, there are some [app limits](#limits) to be aware of that will hopefully help you avoid problems in the future e.g. crashing, building issues
