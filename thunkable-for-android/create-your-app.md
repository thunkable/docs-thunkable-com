#### **Thunkable for Android **❤

# Create your app

---

We designed Thunkable to work for non-developers by eliminating the need to write any code to build a powerful and beautiful native, mobile app. To create your app, simply:

* [Add Components](#add-components-to-tap-into-the-native-capabilities-of-your-phone-and-your-favorite-services)
* [Connect Blocks](#connect-blocks-to-add-functionality-to-your-app)

If this is your first time on Thunkable, we highly recommend that you [watch this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ7z3t-98O0)

There are some [app limits](#limits) to be aware of that will hopefully help you avoid any problems in the future
