# Label

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Label component currently has centering issues on larger screens, such as tablets or computer screens.   
If this behavior is affecting your project, we recommend displaying your text on a [Button](button.md), which can be styled to look like a Label.
{% endhint %}

## Style the Label

You can customize your label using the following properties: 

* **Text:** Text that appears on the label
