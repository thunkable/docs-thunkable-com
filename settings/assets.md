# Assets

Use the **Assets Panel** to upload, rename and manage all of the assets you've uploaded to your project. You can also manage Figma files within this panel. To learn more about how to use the Figma upload feature, check it out [here](../figma.md).&#x20;

## Account Storage Limits

Each plan has a limited storage capacity.&#x20;

## Uploading & Managing Assets

Assets can be uploaded from multiple parts of Thunkable, however, with limited storage capacity, it's best to delete assets that aren't being used. To access your assets, click the Assets button on the left panel.

### Maximum recommended asset size&#x20;

We recommend that each of your asset files not exceed 50KB -100KB. Using smaller file sizes in your project will result in faster loading times for your users.

### Naming assets

We recommend using a consistent naming method for your assets. This will make it easier to manage them if you use many asset files in your project.

Here are two naming methods we recommend:

1. [Snake Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake\_case) - each space is replaced by an [underscore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore) (\_) character, and the first letter of each word written in lowercase.
   * example\_one.png
   * here\_is\_another\_example.html
2. [Camel Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel\_case) - writing phrases without spaces or punctuation, indicating the separation of words with a single [capitalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization) letter, and the first word starting with either case.
   * exampleOne.png
   * hereIsAnotherExample.html

{% hint style="warning" %}
Use only alphanumeric characters and underscores in your asset names. Avoid other special characters and whitespace characters (" ") in your file names as these can cause problems with your project.
{% endhint %}

You can manage your files directly in the Assets panel on the left, or click the plus icon next to the Media Files header to open the Media Files modal and manage them there.&#x20;
