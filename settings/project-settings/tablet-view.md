# Tablet View

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature may only be available for Creators on certain Thunkable plans. Please refer to our [pricing page](https://thunkable.com/#/pricing) for more information.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

Creators on certain Thunkable plans can set their app's default layout to tablet view.&#x20;

The best practice is to set your project's default app layout _before_ you add components to your app screens. If you add components to your app screens and _then_ change your project's default app layout, your designs will not automatically respond to the new size and layout, meaning that neither the size of your existing components nor the distance between components will change.

## Change the Default App Layout&#x20;

To change your app's default app layout:

1. On the Design tab of your project, click the **gear icon** in the upper left corner to access your project's App Settings.
2. Select the preferred default layout for your app. The options are:
   * Phone + Portrait (default)
   * Phone + Landscape
   * Tablet + Portrait
   * Tablet + Landscape
