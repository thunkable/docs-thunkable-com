# ðŸ“± Publish

Since Thunkable allows you to build one app that works on Android and iOS devices, most Creators who want to distribute and monetize their app with larger audiences choose to publish in both the Apple App and Google Play Stores.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Apple App Store review is typically more rigorous and consequently more time-intensive than the Google Play Store review--but both stores are continually raising the bar for what can be listed in their stores.

You may need to create screenshots in different sizes for your app listing. You can learn how to do that here: [Generate Screenshots](generate-screenshots.md).
