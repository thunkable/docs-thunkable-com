# 🆕 Create New Project

A project is a place where your designs, files and blocks come together to create Android and iOS apps. There are four different types of project in Thunkable.

1. [Public Projects](./#public-projects)
2. [Private Projects](./#private-projects)
3. [Read-Only Projects](./#read-only-projects)
4. [Legacy Projects](./#legacy-projects)

When you first sign in to Thunkable you will be prompted to create a project. To learn more about the maximum size your projects can be, please see our article about the [minimum requirements](assets.md#app-size-limits-50-mb-per-app) for apps.

## Public Projects

Public projects are included in the [Thunkable Public Gallery](../public-gallery.md) for anyone to preview, download or remix. If you create a public project, please know that it can be viewed by anyone in the Thunkable community. 

## Private Projects

Private projects are just that, private. They can only be seen by their app creator and do not get included in the [Thunkable Public Gallery.](../public-gallery.md) Only Thunkable PRO users can create and share private projects.

## Making Projects Public or Private

To make your projects public or private, click the "details" button on a project. You can then click the Public/Private switch to change who can view your project.

You can also click on your project name in the upper left hand corner, and click the switch to set your project to public or private.

## Read-Only projects

Private projects become Read-Only projects when a Thunker's PRO membership expires. Read-Only projects remain private and are not included in the Thunkable Gallery.

You can only preview Read-Only. Once a project has been switched to Public, you cannot switch it back to Read-Only.
