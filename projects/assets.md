# Project Assets and Sizes

It's best to keep app sizes as small as possible to preserve space on people's devices. All app projects have a 50MB limit, and free Thunkable accounts have a 200 MB total storage limit. If you need more storage fo your account then you can [upgrade to PRO](https://x.thunkable.com/account/membership) to get 1 GB of space for your projects.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Thunkable PRO subscribers get 1GB of storage and can create unlimited public and [private](./#private-projects) projects.

You must ensure your file names do not have spaces. Here are two methods of naming that are acceptable. \
1\) [Snake Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake\_case) - each space is replaced by an [underscore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore) (\_) character, and the first letter of each word written in lowercase.

* here\_is\_another\_example.html

2\) [Camel Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel\_case) - writing phrases without spaces or punctuation, indicating the separation of words with a single [capitalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization) letter, and the first word starting with either case.

The main contributor to an app's size are files (also known as assets). To add or delete files, click on the Assets button in the side bar. Then click the "+" icon to manage all the files in your project.&#x20;
