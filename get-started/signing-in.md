# Signing In

## **Sign Up**

If you've never used Thunkable before then you should visit our [sign up](https://x.thunkable.com/signup) page. The sign up page gives you two options. You can either sign up with a Google account or an Apple account and sign in immediately, or you can enter your email address and to be sent a magic sign-in link. We recommend using a Google or Apple account, as it will make testing your app a little easier.

The email will look something like the image below. Pressing the **Click to Sign In** button will open your new Thunkable account and keep you signed in for 30 days, unless you choose to sign out sooner.

### **Sign in with Google**

This button will sign you in automatically with your Google account. For most users this will be a Gmail address but if your school or work email is powered by Google then that will work too.

### Sign in with Apple

This button will sign you in automatically with your Apple account.‌

### **Sign in with Email**

If you click **Sign in with email** you will be invited to type you email address in a text input.

When you click **Email me the link** we will send you a link that will sign you back into your account.
