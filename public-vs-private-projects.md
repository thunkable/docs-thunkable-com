# Public & Private Projects

## Public Projects

Public projects are included in the [Thunkable Public Gallery](https://docs.thunkable.com/untitled) for anyone to preview, download or remix. If you create a public project, please know that it can be viewed by anyone in the Thunkable community. 

## Private Projects

Private projects are just that, private. They can only be seen by their app creator and do not get included in the [Thunkable Public Gallery.](https://docs.thunkable.com/untitled) Only Thunkable PRO users can create and share private projects.

## Making Projects Public or Private

To make your projects public or private, click the "details" button on a project. You can then click the Public/Private switch to change who can view your project.

## Read-Only projects

Private projects become Read-Only projects when a Thunker's PRO membership expires. Read-Only projects remain private and are not included in the Thunkable Gallery.

You can only preview Read-Only. Once a project has been switched to Public, you cannot switch it back to Read-Only.

## Legacy projects

The term Legacy projects refers to apps that were built on Thunkable before Thunkable PRO existed. If you are a long-term Thunkable user and have legacy projects, they can be edited in private mode at any time.
