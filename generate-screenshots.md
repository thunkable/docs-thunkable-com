#### Upload 5.8 inch screenshots in Media Manager

When you look at your screenshot upload window, you will see the text ‘View All Sizes in Media Manager’. Click here. In the iOS tab, you will see a segment that says ‘6.5-inch display’. At the bottom of this segment you will see the text ‘5.8-inch display’. Next to this you will see a checkbox with the text ‘Use 6.5-inch Display’. Uncheck this box and expand the ‘5.8-inch Display’ segment. Click on ‘Choose File’, and upload your 5.8-inch screenshots.

#### Resize 5.8 inch screenshots to 6.5 inch screenshots

Use an image editor of your choice to resize your iPhone X screenshots from 1125 x 2436 pixels (5.8-inch Display) to 1242 x 2688 pixels (6.5-inch Display). Upload your new 6.5-inch screenshots to the App Store.
