# Generate Screenshots

By adding app screenshots that showcase your app's features and functionality on its store listing page, you can help your app attract new users on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. They are a requirement of the publishing process.&#x20;

To generate app screenshots, the instructions vary depending on your Thunkable plan.

## **Required screenshot sizes for App Store**

[Here](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/screenshot-specifications) is a list of screenshot sizes you need to publish to the App Store.

To get all of the screenshot sizes you need, create screenshots using the following device settings. Each device name will be followed by its corresponding screen size in the screenshot doc linked above.

iPhone X (5.8 inch screenshots)

iPhone 6/7/8 Plus (5.5 inch screenshots)

iPad Pro (12.9 inch screenshots - suitable for iPad Pro 3rd gen and iPad Pro 2nd gen screenshots described in doc)

5.8 inch screenshots are used as an alternative to 6.5 inch screenshots. There are two ways to upload these iPhone X screenshots to your App Store listing:
{% endhint %}

#### Upload 5.8 inch screenshots in Media Manager

When you look at your screenshot upload window, you will see the text ‘View All Sizes in Media Manager’. Click here. In the iOS tab, you will see a segment that says ‘6.5-inch display’. At the bottom of this segment you will see the text ‘5.8-inch display’. Next to this, you will see a checkbox with the text ‘Use 6.5-inch Display’. Uncheck this box and expand the ‘5.8-inch Display’ segment. Click on ‘Choose File’, and upload your 5.8-inch screenshots.

#### Resize 5.8 inch screenshots to 6.5 inch screenshots

Use an image editor of your choice to resize your iPhone X screenshots from 1125 x 2436 pixels (5.8-inch Display) to 1242 x 2688 pixels (6.5-inch Display). Upload your new 6.5-inch screenshots to the App Store.
