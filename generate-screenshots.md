Uncheck this box and expand the ‘5.8-inch Display’ segment. Click on ‘Choose File’, and upload your 5.8-inch screenshots.

#### Resize 5.8 inch screenshots to 6.5 inch screenshots

Use an image editor of your choice to resize your iPhone X screenshots from 1125 x 2436 pixels \(5.8-inch Display\) to 1242 x 2688 pixels \(6.5-inch Display\). Upload your new 6.5-inch screenshots to the App Store.
