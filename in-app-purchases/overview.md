In-App Purchases (IAPs) are a great way to monetize your app. These allow you to offer access to specific in-app sections. This allows you to offer some content to the general user, but also offer ‘premium’ content/features of your app for a price.​To begin, you'll need to take care of a few details for either platform you plan to incorporate IAP with. Follow the links below to get the groundwork laid to begin using IAP in your app!
