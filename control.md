# Control

## Navigate to a Screen

You can manage much of your screen navigation through our [Top Tab](top-tab-navigator.md), [Bottom Tab](bottom-tab-navigator.md), [Drawer](drawer-navigator.md) and [Stack](broken-reference) navigator components but for simple screen navigation, you can use the very popular block below

## If `this`, do `that`

![Simple if this, do that block](<.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2018-05-22 at 6.47.02 AM (1).png>)

In most apps, one event leads to another event if a **condition** is met. To specify these scenarios, the `this`, do `that` block is commonly used with [Logic](logic.md) blocks that define the conditions that lead one event to the next.

The if `this`, do `that` block can be transformed to support more complex logic

### Test

The Test block can be used to return a value based on a given condition. If the condition is true, one value is returned. If the condition is false, a different value is returned.
