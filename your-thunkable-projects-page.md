### Filter public/private projects

[PRO Thunkable creators](https://thunkable.com/#/pricing) are able to create [private projects](projects.md#private-projects). You can use the Public and Private checkboxes to filter your projects, showing only public projects or only private projects.

You can **delete **your project, **duplicate **your project, or see your **Project detail page.**

### **Your Project Detail Page**

On the Project Detail page, you can test out your app, similar to when it has been published as a [mobile web app](publish-as-a-web-app-pro.md#mobile-web-app).&#x20;

Your project will be shown in your chosen [Default App Layout](project-settings.md#default-app-layout).

You can also view information about the project, such as its name, creator, project size, and how many times it has been remixed or favorited.

If the project is a remix of another project, the name and creator of the original project will be displayed on the left.
