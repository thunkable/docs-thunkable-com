#### Detect Phone's Angular Velocity

| Event / Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Available | Indicates whether the orientation sensor is present on the Android device. Not all Android devices have orientation sensors |
| Magnitude | Returns a number between 0 and 1 that indicates how much the device is tilted. It gives the magnitude of the force that would be felt by a ball rolling on the surface of the device |
| Angle | Returns an angle that tells the direction in which the device is tiled. That is, it tells the direction of the force that would be felt by a ball rolling on the surface of the device |
| Orientation Changed \(azimuth, pitch, roll\) | Called when the orientation has changed |
| Azimuth | Returns the azimuth angle of the device |
| Pitch | Returns the pitch angle of the device |
| Roll | Returns the roll angle of the device |
