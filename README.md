## Not a developer?

Perfect.  `Thunkable was designed for people who have no prior coding experience.` Building mobile apps can be quite a challenge especially for someone who is not a coder. On Thunkable, all you need to build an app is a problem that can be solved with the latest technologies and some lego skills. Instead of writing code, you connect lego blocks. We'll help you do the rest.
