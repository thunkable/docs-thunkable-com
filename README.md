# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Thunkable

Welcome to Thunkable! We're excited to help you begin your app building journey.

On Thunkable, anyone can easily design beautiful apps, program powerful functionality with drag & drop blocks, and upload apps to the [Google Play Store](publish-to-play-store-android.md) and [Apple's App Store](publish-to-app-store-ios/).

You can also build [web apps](https://docs.thunkable.com/publish-as-a-web-app-pro), which are apps that you don't need to download and can be directly accessed online.&#x20;

All apps built on Thunkable work for both Android and iOS devices (see:[ minimum requirements](projects/assets.md)).&#x20;

You can get started by remixing existing projects from our [Sample Apps Page](https://docs.thunkable.com/sample-apps) or [Public Gallery](https://docs.thunkable.com/public-gallery).

## Tutorial videos

You can check out our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTVZRyybOCDBL2zLXSeQVsw) for video tutorials, from Beginner to Advanced.
