## What is Thunkable?

No longer do you have to speak the language of code to build your own apps. On Thunkable, building your on app is as simple as dragging and dropping your favorite components and connecting them together with blocks.

No longer do you have to pick between building your app for your Android or iOS audience. On Thunkable, you build your app once and it works on both platforms.

No longer do you have to build your app from scratch. Thunkable is building the world's largest gallery of open sourced app projects in the world to both inspire you and save you time.

No longer do you have to build your app by yourself. Thunkable has one of the most active and engaged communities in the world. When they can't figure it out, you can chat with us directly.
