## What is Thunkable?

#### Thunkable's mission is simple -- to radically lower the bar to building your own app.

On Thunkable, no longer do you have to speak the language of code to make apps to solve problems for the businesses that you love, the communities in which you are a part or just for yourself, because you are worth it.

Thunkable offers a robust set of popular platforms where millions of Thunkers around the world are building their own mobile apps without having to code. Available on Android, iOS or both.
