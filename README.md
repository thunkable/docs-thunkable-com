# üëã Welcome to Thunkable

Welcome to Thunkable! We're excited to help you begin your app building journey.

On Thunkable, anyone can easily design beautiful apps, program powerful functionality with drag & drop blocks, and upload apps to the [Google Play Store](publish-to-play-store-android.md) and [Apple's App Store](publish-to-app-store-ios/).

You can also build [web apps](https://docs.thunkable.com/publish-as-a-web-app-pro), which are apps that you don't need to download and can be directly accessed online.&#x20;

All apps built on Thunkable work for both Android and iOS devices (see:[ minimum requirements](assets.md)).&#x20;

You can get started by remixing existing projects from our [Sample Apps Page](https://docs.thunkable.com/sample-apps) or [Public Gallery](https://docs.thunkable.com/public-gallery).

## docs.thunkable.com is now home to Thunkable's Drag and Drop Docs!

On August 10th, we transitioned [docs.thunkable.com](https://docs.thunkable.com) to host our documentation for Thunkable's Drag and Drop platform. Previously, this URL was home to our Snap to Place documentation, which is now at an [alternate URL](https://docs.thunkable.com/v/snap-to-place).

### **What's Drag and Drop vs. Snap to Place?**

### **What does this mean for you?**

* If you link out to Thunkable Docs in any capacity, please check with the chart above to make sure you are linking to the right documentation. You will need to make changes no matter which platform you intend to point to.
* You can always switch between our two platform docs on the upper left hand corner of the docs.
