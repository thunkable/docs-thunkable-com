## One Product, Two Interfaces

The first thing you need to know as we welcome you to our Thunkable Docs is that we have two libraries of documents. One for each of the interfaces we currently offer:

### **Drag and Drop**&#x20;

Drag and Drop is our new platform interface that took our Creator's favorite features and functions from the previous interface (Snap to Place) and improved on them.

You'll know if you're looking for support with the Drag and Drog interface if your screen looks like this:

You're in the right place if you're looking for the Thunkable Docs supporting our Drag and Drop interface.

### **Snap to Place**

Snap to Place was our first foray into cross-platform app development. It is our old platform interface.&#x20;

You'll know if you're looking for support with the Snap to Place interface if your screen looks like this:

The Thunkable Docs to support users of the Snap to Place interface are available here: [Snap to Place Docs](https://docs.thunkable.com/v/snap-to-place/)
