# Canvas Label

The Canvas Label is a piece of text that can be placed onto your [Stage](canvas.md#the-stage).&#x20;

## Adding a Canvas Label to your app

To add a Canvas Label to your app, click on the Stage of your Canvas. This will automatically bring you to the Canvas tab. Underneath your component tree, where you would see a component menu in the Design tab, you will see your Sprite Type menu and a User Interface menu. You can find the Canvas Label in the Unser Interface menu.
