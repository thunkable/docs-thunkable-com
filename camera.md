## Base64 Encoding

Provided an image, video or audio file, this block generates a Base64 encoded file. _(Alternate Description: This block receives an image, video or audio file, and returns it Base64 encoded.)_

Projects are restricted to 50MB total asset storage. Individual files using the Base64 block are subject to the same restrictions.  Based on our internal testing, maximum file size for Base64 encoding in web apps and web previewing is 10 MB, 40 MB in iOS and Android platforms.

{% hint style="info" %}
Keep in mind that while a file is encoding, your Thunkable app will not be able to navigate to other screens or engage in other functionality.  It is best to keep file sizes well below the maximum for best performance.
{% endhint %}
