## Take Photo

The camera block has three outputs:

 **i\) Photo:** This saves the photo taken by the user.

**ii\) DidUserCancel:** This is either true or false depending on whether the user cancelled taking the picture

**iii\) Error:** Indicates if there was an error when the photo was taken

![The blocks below say that when Button1 is clicked, open the camera. Then set the photo taken to be the picture displayed on the screen. ](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/8heKZ_1gASVYkGgBwyIzqEf5XYjKzZTmZM3oPIJtNSVqD9XjEfUWzsu5XI4qa3fQUhE0vCmMaXxBxhbYZwltlRrArZCWs9DfFA1A3LSdxfBNRqvMQNhtploWHnvIOiFbFUp-kJMi)
