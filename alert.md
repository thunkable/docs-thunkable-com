## Blocks

If you want to start an event from a confirm button, you will want to add the blocks below:

## Button List: Alert with three or more buttons

It is possible to add buttons to an alert for more sophisticated use cases.\
This can be done using the `set Button List to` block by creating a [list](lists.md) of [objects](objects.md).

You can set the **Text **of the Alert. You can set the **Style **of the Alert to **ok, destructive **or** cancel.**

On iOS, the Alert can show more than 3 Buttons.\
On Android, the Alert can show up to 3 buttons. If more than 3 buttons are specified, the first 3 will be shown. \

| Message          | The subtitle of the alert                                                                                                                        |
| Text `Advanced`  | The text of the button                                                                                                                           |
| Style `Advanced` | The style of the button; `ok` is a confirm button, `cancel` is a cancel button and `destructive` is a confirm button with text in red (iOS only) |

The 'showButtonList' block will return an output called 'buttonPressed'.\
This will return the position of the Button in your Button List.\
You can take some action based on which button was pressed.

Note: the Buttons may appear in a different order when testing the app on a device. \
The number that ‘buttonPressed’ returns is the order that the Buttons are added in the app project.
