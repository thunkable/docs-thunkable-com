{% endcontent-ref %}

## **Step 2. Complete the Thunkable Academy Course**

Check out our courses in [Thunkable Academy](https://academy.thunkable.com/) to familiarize yourself with the platform and build your first app.

## Step 3. Test your project

Once you have followed a tutorial, test your project on the web to see it live.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="live-test.md" %}
[live-test.md](live-test.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## **Step 4.** **Download the Thunkable Live App**

The Thunkable Live app lets you preview your apps directly on your personal devices. Links to download for Android and iOS are here: [Thunkable Live App](https://thunkable.com/#/mobile)

If you don't have an iOS or Android device, you can [set up an emulator](emulators.md) on your computer that will display your apps.

## Step 5. Check out your Thunkable Projects page

View the homepage for all of your Thunkable creations. Choose how you want your projects to be laid out. Search and filter your projects.

{% content-ref url="your-thunkable-projects-page.md" %}
[your-thunkable-projects-page.md](your-thunkable-projects-page.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Step 6. Create a new Project

Continue your journey by creating more projects.

{% content-ref url="projects.md" %}
[projects.md](projects.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Step 7. Components and Features

You can drop custom components and third-party integrations directly into your projects. These components will allow you to build more advanced features. &#x20;

{% content-ref url="components.md" %}
[components.md](components.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Step 8. Blocks

The language of blocks is a visible programming language. By dragging and dropping blocks together, you can program your app.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="blocks.md" %}
[blocks.md](blocks.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
