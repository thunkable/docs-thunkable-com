## PRO-TIPS

## **Step 1.** **Download the Thunkable mobile app\(s\).**

Before you do anything else, we recommend downloading the Thunkable mobile app\(s\). This will let you [preview](live-test.md) any app project on your device. Hooray!

| [**Download for Android**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thunkable.live) |
| :--- |


| [**Download for iOS**](http://appstore.com/thunkablelive) |
| :--- |


If you don't have an iOS or Android device, you can also [set up an emulator](emulators.md) on your computer that will mimic what you would see on an actual device.

## **Step 2. Learn how the platform works with a tutorial.**

We have beginner tutorials built into the platform with [companion videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrONgW8udmM&list=PLB89L9PPGIrwpd62eYs6iOsHpjYboyuZE) if you prefer.
