## [Inventory app template](https://x.thunkable.com/projectPage/61ba4264b6b4c7001012d714)

Managing inventory involves tracking many things, like:

* when to order new inventory
* how much of any given product you have at a given moment
* updating your inventory tracking as soon as you have bought or sold some inventory
* avoiding mix-ups from having multiple data sources to track your inventory with different information on them

This makes inventory management important to SMBs. Tracking the ins and outs of your business can prove challenging, but it need not be!

This app connects the sales process with the ordering process. Seamless, dynamic inventory.
