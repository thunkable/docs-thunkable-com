# Spreadsheet by Airtable

Airtable is a service that looks like a spreadsheet but actually acts like a database so it can do database-like things like store attachments i.e. images in your spreadsheets \(and not just text\) and link records between spreadsheets.

We like Airtable because set-up is relatively a breeze for a spreadsheet

* [Getting, uploading, updating and deleting data](spreadsheet.md#getting-uploading-updating-and-deleting-data-in-a-spreadsheet)

## Set up

### Create your [free Airtable](https://airtable.com/) spreadsheet and account

### Connect your Airtable spreadsheet with Thunkable

There are four properties that you need to retrieve from Airtable to connect it with Thunkable: `API key`, `Base ID`, `Table Name` and `View Name`

`Base ID`

To retrieve the Base ID, you'll actually have go to the [Airtable API documentation](https://airtable.com/api) page and select your spreadsheet. You'll then have to select the Node.js tab of the code editor and find the Base ID in the code as shown below

`Table Name` and `View Name`

The Table Name and View Name can be retrieved by grabbing the fields from your spreadsheet as shown below. Your default Table Name should be "Table 1". Your default View Name should be "Grid View".
