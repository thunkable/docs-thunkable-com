### Open an installed app with a deep link

A user can open an app installed on their phone by clicking a deep link either for Android, iOS or both. Deep links aren't easily discoverable but you can find deep links for commonly installed apps at a helpful site called [URL genius](https://app.urlgeni.us/#/)

#### Example ①  Open the Thunkable Instagram on iOS or Android \(if installed\)
