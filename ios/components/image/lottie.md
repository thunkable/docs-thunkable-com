[Lottie Animation](https://airbnb.design/lottie/) renders animations created in [Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) in real time, allowing apps to use animations as easily as they use static images.

There is a large and growing community of designers who have [created free and editable animations](https://www.lottiefiles.com/community) in After Effects that you can easily add to your app.

Big thanks to the team at Airbnb for enabling one of the most popular open technologies in apps today!
