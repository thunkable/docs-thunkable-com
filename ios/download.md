#### **Thunkable for iOS **

# Step 4 `Download`

---

Most iOS developers have to sign up for an [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) membership \(currently $99/year\) to download an app to their iPhone or iPad.  Thunkable is making it possible to download an iOS app made on Thunkable to your iPhone or iPad without a membership.

Currently, it is possible to download** only one Thunkable app on your phone** at one time

* [Add a Custom Icon and App Name](/ios/components/app-settings/custom-icon-+-app-name.md) \(optional\)
