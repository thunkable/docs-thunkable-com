### 1 / When you are ready to share your app project, generate a link to a copy of your app project \(including assets and other contents\). IMPORTANT: Make sure that there is no information including passwords, API keys or proprietary app assets that you want to share with your app ![](/assets/share-✕-fig-2.gif)When you select 'Generate', we will make a copy of your app project at the current moment in time

### 2 / Copy and share your link with your collaborators, the wider Thunkable community or maybe even your mom!

### If you make changes to your app project, you will have to generate a new link if you want users to receive your latest version
