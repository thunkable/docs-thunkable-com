## Arrange Screens with Navigators

Most apps navigate through screens using navigators. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9R_kg4ew2M) to watch a tutorial on how to use each navigator. 

Here are three examples of navigators that you can use on Thunkable.

1. \*\*\*\*[**Bottom**](https://docs.thunkable.com/bottom-tab-navigator) **and** [**Top Tab**](https://docs.thunkable.com/top-tab-navigator) **Navigators** - These navigators allow you to change screens by clicking on icons at the top or bottom of the screen.
