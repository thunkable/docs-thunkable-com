### Connect your Dialogflow agent with Thunkable

To connect your Dialogflow agent to Thunkable, you'll have to find the `Client Access Token`

To find the `Client Access Token`, you'll have to first create an agent and then navigate to the General tab with the Settings page. Each agent has a unique Client Access Token

### Create Intents with Text Responses

After you create our account, you will be asked to create an intent, which is simply a user expression that will prompt a given text response. The more intents that you create, the more commands or questions the Assistant will be able to respond to. Since the Assistant is powered by a breakthrough technology called natural language processing, the user won't have to always say exactly what is specified in the intents \(although the more expressions the better\)![](.gitbook/assets/assistant-ios-fig-1.png)![](.gitbook/assets/assistant-ios-fig-2.png)

## Activate the Assistant

The Assistant is powered by a speech recognizer which listens to a voice query. It's important to make sure the Assistant has enough time to listen to a voice query and return a response. The blocks below illustrate one way of implementing the Assistant Start and Stop procedures.

If the query is successful, it will return a text `value` that you can use to speak aloud or play a given sound as illustrated below
