# Adding Files and Managing Storage

It's better to keep app sizes as small as possible to preserve space on people's devices. All app projects have a 50MB limit, and Thunkable accounts have a 200MB total limit. 

## App size limits \(50MB per app\)

| Element | Limit |
| :--- | :--- |
| App size | 50 MB |
| Account size limit | 200 MB |
| Screens | No fixed limit |
| Download | One app per phone for iOS; no limit for Android |
| Minimum Android version | 5.0 \(21\) Lollipop |
| Minimum iOS version | 10.0 |

You can view a project's app size on the project's details page:

The main contributor to an app's size are files \(also known as assets\). To add or delete files, click on the expand icon in the files section:

## Account storage limits \(200MB per account\)

You can view your total account storage size in your account settings.

If you are near the limit, you may be able to create additional storage by removing projects that you no longer need like an old version or copy of a project. We may add the option for you to purchase additional storage in the future.
