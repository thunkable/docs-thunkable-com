# ðŸ’¾ Managing Storage

&#x20;The size of your Thunkable project is generous, but finite. Projects created with free accounts need to be slightly smaller, while PRO subscribers will have a more generous allowance of project storage but in either case you will want to make the most out of every megabyte.&#x20;

### Project Size

You can find a table of project sizes here:

{% content-ref url="assets.md" %}
[assets.md](assets.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Cloud Storage

Depending on when you need an asset, storing it in the cloud might make sense. Using cloud storage in your app will not impact your local project size. Thunkable provides multiple third-party integrations, including [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/), [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/), and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

### Refactoring your App

Sometimes there's simply no option left other than to go back through your app and make it more efficient. Some tips for refactoring your app include:

* Reduce block count by creating [functions](functions.md)
* Use [loops](control.md#repeat-an-event) to perform repetitive tasks
* Use the [Any Component](any-component-blocks.md) blocks as much as possible

## Disable app screen preview

You can disable screen preview for apps with many screens to improve platform performance and load time. When enabled, the project only loads the screen you're working on, and the others are paused.&#x20;

To disable app screen preview:

1. Click your **account avatar or icon** in the upper right corner.&#x20;
2. Select **Settings**.&#x20;
3. Click the **FEATURES** tab.
4. Toggle on **Disable app screen preview**.
