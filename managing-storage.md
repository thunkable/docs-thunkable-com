# ðŸ’¾ Managing Storage

&#x20;The size of your Thunkable project is generous, but finite. Projects created with free accounts need to be slightly smaller, while PRO subscribers will have a more generous allowance of project storage but in either case you will want to make the most out of every megabyte.&#x20;

### Project Size

You can find a table of project sizes here:

{% content-ref url="assets.md" %}
[assets.md](assets.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Cloud Storage

Depending on when you need an asset, storing it in the cloud might make sense. Using cloud storage in your app will not impact your local project size. Thunkable provides multiple third-party integrations, including [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/), [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/), and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

### Refactoring your App

Sometimes there's simply no option left other than to go back through your app and make it more efficient. Some tips for refactoring your app include:

* Reduce block count by creating [functions](functions.md)
* Use [loops](control.md#repeat-an-event) to perform repetitive tasks
* Use the [Any Component](any-component-blocks.md) blocks as much as possible
