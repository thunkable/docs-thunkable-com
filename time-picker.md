Time Pickers are helpful when you want the user of your app to easily select a specific time using the native Android or iOS date picker

## Set up 

The Time Picker is only surfaced after you have triggered it from another event so you'll need to select the event using an event block like the one below.

After the user has selected a date, you will get the following outputs which you can format however you choose

| Property | Output |
| :--- | :--- |
| Hours | Hour of the Day from `1-24` |
| Minutes | Minutes from `1-60` |
