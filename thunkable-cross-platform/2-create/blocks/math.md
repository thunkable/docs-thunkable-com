## Numeric value

You can also round up or down a decimal figure into an integer using the block below

There is also a block for irrational numbers like `π`

## Perform calculations

Perhaps the most often used calculation in an app is `addition` but this block also supports `subtraction`, `multiplication`, `division` and `exponential` figures

There are also a few more advanced calculation blocks that may be helpful including `trigonometric`

`logarithmic`

and `remainder`

There's also this useful calculation block for lists

## Introduce randomness

For games and other apps, it may be important to introduce randomness into your app

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/blocks-math-fig-11.png)![](../../../.gitbook/assets/blocks-math-fig-12.png)

One way to select randomly from a list is depicted below

## Other

There are a couple of blocks that don't seem to fit into the previous categories that may be helpful for your app
