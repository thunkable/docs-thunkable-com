  Apps have evolved from one simple screen to an assortment of layouts that
  maximize a user's experience in a limited amount of screen real estate

# Layout

### Screens are the main organizing elements of apps

The most effective apps are built around a central home screen

{% hint style="info" %}
There are [no limits](https://thunkable.gitbook.io/thunkable-docs/~/edit/primary/thunkable-cross-platform/2-create/app-limits) to the number of screens
{% endhint %}

### Arrange Screens with Navigators

Most modern apps navigate through screens using bottom or top tab menus which enable swiping between screens \([Tab Navigator](tab-navigator.md)\), side menus that are invisible until swiped to appear \([Drawer Navigator](drawer-navigator.md)\) or stacking a new screen that can be dismissed \([Stack Navigator](stack-navigator.md)\). 

{% hint style="info" %}
For screens to work with a navigator, they need to be dropped fully within its tree hierarchy.
{% endhint %}

### Arrange elements within a Screen with Rows and Columns

Screens can be subdivided by Row and Column containers, the first aligns elements horizontally and the second aligns them vertically.
