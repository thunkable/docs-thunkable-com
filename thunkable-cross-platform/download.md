### Keep your .apk file

If you are using the latest version of Chrome you might see a notification that your app "_is not commonly downloaded and may be dangerous_". While some .apk files can potentially contain malicious software you are downloading an app that you have created yourself so there is no danger here. You can click on the "More Options" menu and choose the "Keep" option as highlighted below to complete your download.

### To install, allow apps from Unknown sources

Anyone installing your app directly, instead of from the Play Store, will need to change the setting on their phone to allow installation of apps from Unknown sources
