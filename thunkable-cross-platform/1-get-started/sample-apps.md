# Sample Apps

##  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/remix-icon.png)

Thunkable is building the world's largest gallery of open sourced apps to help inspire you and save you time.

Below are a few of our favorites with more to come. Feel free to remix!

## Beginner

### New Market Goods

New Market Goods is a simple website app with a branding screen and a social media bar that opens a deep link to a user's installed apps that works across platforms. We recommend [URL genius](https://app.urlgeni.us/#/) to find deep links for commonly used apps. No set-up is required.

## **Medium**

### Aloha

Aloha is a private anonymous chat app with a short chat history powered by a [Firebase Realtime Database](../2-create/components/data-storage/realtime-db.md). To [keep your data as private as possible](../2-create/app-data-privacy.md#create-your-own-private-repository-of-cloud-data), we recommend creating your own Firebase account and add your own API keys.

### **こんにちは \(Kon'nichiwa\)**

こんにちは is an app designed for travel in any country. It uses the newly upgraded [Speech Recognizer](../2-create/components/artificial-intelligence/speech-recognizer.md) combined with the [Translator](../2-create/components/artificial-intelligence/translator.md) component powered by Yandex to translate any spoke phrase into one of 87 supported languages. The app also features persistent data using [Local Storage](../2-create/components/data-storage/local-storage.md), importing a list of data from [Spreadsheet](../2-create/components/data-storage/spreadsheet.md), and sharing results with the [Share](../2-create/components/social/share.md) component.

### Personal Feed

Personal Feed is an easy to edit feed of your favorite websites, powered by a simple Airtable [spreadsheet](../2-create/components/data-storage/spreadsheet.md) with descriptions that you can modify at any time. This app can be remixed in a number of ways but this example shares popular men's blogger Mister Ching's favorite products for the summer. This app features a Stack Navigator, a Share component, and custom fonts in Labels as well!

### Social Credit

Social Credit is a team counting app for thankless tasks. The app shares data for the team in a private Firebase realtime database account so Thunkers looking to create one for their team will need to [set one up](https://docs.thunkable.com/x/components/data-storage/realtime-db.html#set-up). The app also features some basic error handling and a for loop block

### Weather

Weather is an app that pulls the latest temperature from the Weather Underground API and as a bonus the latest traffic from the Google Maps component; Thunkers will need to create a free account to create their own Weather Underground API key

### Translator

Translator is an app that translates English text into the 20 most popular languages in the world; features advanced use of ListView and persistent data with Local Storage. No set-up is required although Thunkers can use their own Yandex API key if desired

### Dad

Dad is a digital version of Albert's dad, based on a recorded interview and powered by Dialogflow's [Assistant](../2-create/components/artificial-intelligence/assistant.md) service. Thunkers must create their own Dialogflow account to customize their digital version. You can read more of the story of this app on [our blog](https://blog.thunkable.com/meet-my-dad-in-an-app-8a93ded720e0).

## Advanced

### Ride

Ride is a simple uber-like app designed for a single rider and driver that demonstrates some of the more complex possibilities of using the Google Maps APIs with the [Web API](../2-create/components/data-storage/web-api.md) component including the geocoding, distance matrix and routing APIs.  Developers will have to first create and use their own Google Maps API key and [Realtime DB](../2-create/components/data-storage/realtime-db.md) with Firebase. This is the first sample app that uses the cool renaming component feature that was just implemented.

### Reservation

Reservation is a demonstration of how to accept credit card payments through your app. Thunkers must create their own Stripe account \(please [follow the documentation](https://docs.thunkable.com/ios/components/monetisation/payments.html) carefully on set-up\). The app also uploads user data to a [spreadsheet](https://docs.thunkable.com/ios/components/data-storage/spreadsheets.html) for proper tracking of user transactions.

### Gram

Gram is what photo sharing should be -- ad-free, auto-captioning and secure. This app features the Sign In component with Realtime DB both powered by Firebase, Image Recognizer by Microsoft and a way to "heart" photos. Thunkers must create their own Firebase account and add their own API keys and database url in their account settings.
