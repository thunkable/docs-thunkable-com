## Beginner  <a id="beginner"></a>

### Beaver Bingo  <a id="beaver-bingo"></a>

Beaver Bingo is a simple puzzle app that we think is great for parties. Party goers take photos of the items in the nine boxes, which together reveals a hidden message. The app features the [Image Recognizer](https://docs.thunkable.com/~/revisions/-LOOoZWLYzPlQ4m9-n_W/thunkable-cross-platform/create/components/image/image-recognizer) component from Microsoft. No goats were harmed in the making of this app.

### Ukulele  <a id="ukulele"></a>

Ukulele is a simple soundboard app that plays the ukulele chords for one of our favorite songs of all time \(and of the [best Hawaiian songs of all time](http://www.honolulumagazine.com/Honolulu-Magazine/June-2007/50-Greatest-Songs-of-Hawai-8217i/index.php?cparticle=2&siarticle=1#artanc)\), _Waikiki_, recorded in 1946 by Andy Cummings. The ukulele chords themselves were recorded by an aspiring but very amateur ukulele player / thunker Albert Ching \(originally from Waikiki\)
