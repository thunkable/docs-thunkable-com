# API Keys

## What is an API Key?

With all the APIs in this section, the first thing you will need to do is register for an account with the API owner. Having an account with the API developer will allow you to create your own developer key. Similar to a physical key, your developer API key will grant you access to that information that is "locked away" on the API server. Unlike a physical key however, your developer key is unique so the API owner can see who is accessing the server, when they're accessing it and how many requests they're making. Since usage can often be tied to billing it is recommended that you treat your keys as secrets and don't share them with anyone else.&#x20;
